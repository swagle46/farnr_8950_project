# FANR 8950 Final Project: Georgia FIA Tree Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project performs an exploratory data analysis of the **Georgia Forest Inventory Analysis (FIA)** dataset. The analysis uses both **tree-level** and **plot-level** data to provide insights into:

- Species composition and distribution across Georgia
- Tree size classes, biomass, and height-diameter relationships
- Summary statistics and visualizations for trees and plots
- Temporal patterns in data collection
- Spatial distribution of FIA plots in Georgia

The analysis includes data cleaning, transformation, visualizations, and species-level height-diameter modeling, providing a foundation for future modeling and forest management studies.
